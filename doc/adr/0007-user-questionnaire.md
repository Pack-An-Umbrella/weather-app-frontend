# 7. User Questionnaire

## Status

Accepted

## Context

From a broad concept idea, the team would like to refine the direction of focus based on feedback from our target users. A user questionnaire will help us guage which purposeful features we wish to develop on this iteration of the app.

## Decision
We conducted a questionnaire and received 23 responses from our target user group, on the following product areas:
* Time period users would like to obtain weather information for  
* Weather information users would like to see
* Recommendations users would like the app to give
* Type of location users would like to query the app for

## Consequences

* Assist developers in identifying which data points to capture and expose to the user
* Generation of new ideas through users' feedback
* Users identify features we are unable to offer within the scope of this iteration, and with the limited time the team has to learn and adopt new technologies
* Risk being steered away from original purpose
* Team exercise in defining which features would be included in this iteration of the app, which would be 'nice to have' as a stretch objective should there be time before the project timeline finishes, and which could be features to implement in a future roadmap
