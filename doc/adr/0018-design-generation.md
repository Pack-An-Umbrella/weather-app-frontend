# 18. Design Generation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Agree on a design for the app

## Decision

The team brainstormed design ideas using the 'Crazy 8s' technique to burst as many ideas in a short time, and then three-dot-voted for their favourites. This refined our choice down to three designs, which were similar anyway, so we decided to incorporate the best parts of all three.

## Consequences

* Team need to be flexible in case the design has to change
* Team decided which aspects of the design would be priority (e.g. colour and icons), and which aspects would be nice-to-have (e.g. responsiveness) in case of lack of time
