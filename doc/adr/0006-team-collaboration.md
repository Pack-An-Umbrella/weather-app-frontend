# 6. Team Collaboration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Members of the team have varying responsibilities - such as being in full-time work and stay-at-home mothers - limiting their time commitment to the project. Commuting distance from the office is long, and COVID-19 advice is to work from home.

## Decision

It is decided to work remotely, using Slack and Zoom, to do pair and mob programming.

## Consequences

* Commitment to checking in on Slack, as schedules don't always allow standups
* When stuck, James is to be consulted on a dedicated Slack channel
