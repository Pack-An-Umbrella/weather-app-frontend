# 1. Create A Weather App In React

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The final part of the Tech Returners course is a group project, where participants showcase the software engineering skills acquired on the course, as well as develop their team working and transferrable skills. The weather app is designed to reflect to the user the culturally observed phenomenon which is the frequency of extreme weather in the UK. It is common to require the use of sunglasses and an umbrella within the space of a few hours, with the result that people are often caught out by being unprepared. The weather app will render icons of suggested items to the client, such as an umbrella, sunscreen, a jumper etc, depending on the weather data fed to it.
